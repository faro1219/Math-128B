## Basic Matlab functions 

- [Anonymous functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html)

  - An anonymous function is a function that is *not* stored in a program file, but is associated with a variable whose data type is `function_handle`.

  - e.g.s
    ```matlab
    sqr = @(x) x.^2;
    a = sqr(5);
    ```

    It will return a = 25. 

- Pointwise Power .^

- Absolute value abs

- summation function sum

  - If input is a vector, return the sum of entries.
  - If input is a matrix A,
    - sum(A, 1) return the column sum vector
    - sum(A, 2) return the row sum vector 
    - sum(A, "all") return the sum of all entries

- Generate the arithmetic sequence

- Reshape function Reshape a matrix or a vector into any other shape

  

## Exercises

- Ex.1 Implement the 1norm, 2norm and inf norm of a vector with anonymous functions. Note that your function should be able to accept vectors of any length. 

  - Test: 1norm of vector $(1,2,...,2024)$ 

- Ex.2 Implement the inf norm and Frobenius norm of a matrix with anonymous functions. 

  - Test: 1norm and Frobenius norm of matrix $A = \pmatrix{1 &2 &\cdots &10\\ 11 & 12 &\cdots &20\\ \vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\ 91 & 92 &\vdots &100}$
